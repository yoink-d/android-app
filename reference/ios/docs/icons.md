# Light and dark icons

The supplied `reference/ui/light-icon.png` stays unchanged. `AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon.png` composites it over white, then resizes it to 1024x1024 RGB with Lanczos filtering. `AppResources/BrandMarkLight.png` resizes the supplied transparent artwork to 512x512 without flattening its alpha channel.

The original dark launcher PNG is preserved byte-for-byte as `AppIcon.appiconset/AppIconDark.png`. The separate `AppIconDark.appiconset` uses the same bytes. `AppResources/BrandMark.png` stays unchanged.

## Xcode

The primary `AppIcon` set includes the real dark artwork in its `luminosity: dark` appearance slot. On supported iOS versions, the Home Screen's icon appearance determines which slot renders. The app's own appearance and accent preference do not determine the Home Screen mode.

Keep `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIcon`. Set `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_ALTERNATE_APPICON_NAMES = AppIconDark` in both target configurations to compile the separate alternate set and generate its plist entry. No include-all-icons setting is required for this named set.

The existing asset catalog and AppResources folder registrations include these new files. No individual PNG registration is needed. Leave `CFBundleIcons` and `IYoinksUsesAlternateIconFallback` out of the source `Info.plist`; Xcode generates its icon metadata and does not need the alternate-icon fallback.

## Linux xtool

The installed xtool 1.23.0 `PackLib/Packer.swift` copies `iconPath` unchanged to the app root and sets the generated plist's `CFBundleIconFile` to `AppIcon`. It does not compile this appearance catalog.

After xtool and Python-runtime packaging, `scripts/build-native.sh` runs `doc-python scripts/package-icons.py --ipa xtool/iYoinks.ipa`. This uses Pillow from the existing document environment, not Arch's system Python. It must run before signing.

The step adds both 1024px originals and each appearance's 20, 29, 40 and 60-point PNGs at 2x and 3x. It merges `CFBundlePrimaryIcon` and `CFBundleAlternateIcons` into the generated plist, retaining unrelated keys, primary metadata and other alternate entries. It inserts `IYoinksUsesAlternateIconFallback = true` only in this IPA. Existing ZIP entry permissions and unrelated payload bytes are retained. Running it again produces the same payload.

The primary icon is light. The alternate dictionary key is exactly `AppIconDark`, not `Dark`.

## Automatic appearance

Settings no longer offers a manual icon picker. For an xtool archive with `IYoinksUsesAlternateIconFallback`, the noninteractive appearance observer checks the phone/window-scene traits on foreground and appearance changes. It uses UIKit's existing alternate-icon API:

- Dark uses `UIApplication.shared.setAlternateIconName("AppIconDark", completionHandler: ...)`.
- Light uses `UIApplication.shared.setAlternateIconName(nil, completionHandler: ...)`.
- Check `supportsAlternateIcons`, compare `alternateIconName` and prevent concurrent requests. UIKit completion runs through the main actor before another request is allowed.

Phone appearance drives the icon independently of a forced Light/Dark app appearance or accent theme. Icon changes can display UIKit's system confirmation. Read `alternateIconName` rather than assuming a request succeeded.

xtool's loose PNGs do not provide native luminosity switching, so its automatic alternate-icon fallback is active while the app is running or returns to the foreground. It cannot update while the app is not executing. Home Screen customization, tinted rendering, trait changes, confirmation and persistence need a phone check. The fallback does not override system Home Screen effects.

## Checks

`python3 scripts/check-project.py` verifies both catalogs, PNG integrity and opaque launcher sources, both brand images, preserved dark hashes, absence of the fallback flag in source and the Xcode alternate setting. `python3 scripts/check-ipa.py xtool/iYoinks.ipa` checks the actual ZIP, both masters and all sixteen scaled PNGs, the explicit alternate plist entry, fallback flag and bundled brand bytes alongside existing executable/runtime checks.

Packaging checks do not establish native rendering or UIKit behavior. Xcode catalog compilation still needs an Apple toolchain.
